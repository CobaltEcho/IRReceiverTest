/*
 *  MinimalReceiver.cpp
 *
 *  Small memory footprint and no timer usage!
 *
 *  Receives IR protocol data of NEC protocol using pin change interrupts.
 *  On complete received IR command the function handleReceivedIRData(uint16_t aAddress, uint8_t aCommand, bool isRepetition)
 *  is called in Interrupt context but with interrupts being enabled to enable use of delay() etc.
 *  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 *  Functions called in interrupt context should be running as short as possible,
 *  so if you require longer action, save the data (address + command) and handle it in the main loop.
 *  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
